With the establishment of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, in 1962, it was renamed Abdullahi Bayero College. In 1964 it moved to a temporary site at the old Kano Airport Hotel, admitting its first set of ten undergraduate students for a B.A. degree programme of Ahmadu Bello University.
This first set graduated in 1966 but it continued as a faculty of ABU until 1980. Before then the temporary site had attracted hostile fire during the civil war and had to move to its permanent site (present old campus) in the vicinity of Kabuga and Dukawuya gates on the Kano-Gwarzo road. The next phase of development occurred in 1975, when Abdullahi Bayero College was raised to the status of a University College with the right to award degrees on behalf of Ahmadu Bello University and was renamed Abdullahi Bayero University College, with its own Governing Council.
All University Colleges in the country were raised to the status of fullfledged universities in 1977 by the Federal Government and Abdullahi Bayero University College became Bayero University, Kano (BUK) (backed by the promulgation of BUK Decree no 79 of 1979). Dr. Mahmud Tukur, the Principal of the University College became its pioneer Vice-Chancellor (1977-78) leading the team that laid the foundation and initiated the process that gave rise to the present permanent site and the shape of the university as we know it today.

It is a learning and research institution that seeks to solve immediate needs of the society and give every person the opportunity to acquire knowledge.
The university was established in 2013 by President Goodluck Jonathan. This was done to give every state of Nigeria (those without a federal university) access to higher education and to give all states equal access to education. Yobe State is listed as one of the educationally disadvantaged with low enrollment in schools and high rate of illiteracy.
In its Education Sector reform and development, the Federal Government of Nigeria, in 2010, approved the establishment of twelve (12) universities in the six geopolitical zones of the country. This was to expand access to tertiary education for Nigerians. For effective take off of the universities, an Implementation Committee which includes National Universities Commission (NUC), the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) and other relevant stakeholders was constituted. The Committee held consultations with governors of the states for the new universities and inspected the proposed sites before submitting its report on 15 November 2010. The implementation of the committee's report was in phases. The implementation of the first phase started with the establishment of nine Universities, in February 2011. The implementation of the second phase involved the establishment of three Universities including the FUGashua in February 2013. On 18 February 2013, Professor Shehu Abdul Rahaman was appointed Vice-Chancellor, and Sulu Dauda, Registrar (pioneers). In June 2015, FUGashua matriculated its 240 pioneer students. Three years after the maiden matriculation, student population grew significantly, and in February 2018, 990 students were matriculated.

In August 2003 the University Council formalized the Centre for Climate Change and Freshwater Resources (CCCFR) as one of three newly established Centres. The others are Centre for Human Settlements and Urban Development (CHSUD) and Centre for Remedial and Extra-mural Studies (CRES). The CCCFR in collaboration with environmentalists in the six Geopolitical Zones of Nigeria have just concluded a N105 million National Agro-Climatic Atlas Project to combat effects of climate change-induced natural disaster in Nigeria sponsored by the Ecological Fund Office of the Presidency. The second phase of the project is awaiting Federal Executive Council’s approval. Aart from this project, the Centre is now into collaborative climate change studies with University of Cape Town, South Africa, while its scientists continue as consulting experts with United Nations Agencies like UNFCCC, WMO, UNEP, UNDP, FAO, UNESCO etc. The Centre is also involved in the university’s Sustainable Livelihood initiative in the context of the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2015) and is about to commence a new professional programme in Climate Change Disaster Risk Assessment and Risk Reduction as a prelude to a programme in Disaster Early Warning.
The Centre for Human Settlements and Urban Development (CHSUD) which was established by the University in collaboration with the UN-Habitat is to assist in settlements, Urban Governance and Urban Development. Since then, CHSUD has focused attention on building capacity at all levels of government, for effective Urban Environmental Management such as establishment of Environmental Management Information System, Certificate and Postgraduate Diploma Programmes in Public-Private Partnership for Urban Environment.

On November 28, 1980, in the premises of the Old Government Technical College (GTC), FUTO opened its doors to staff and students.
In January 1982 the Imo State government approved a permanent site for the University.  FUTO engaged Messrs Concarplan – Enplan Group (a firm of Consultants) to design the physical plan for the University. Located 25 kilometers south of Owerri, the selection of the site was guided by the advice of the National Universities Commission that a minimum area of ten thousand (10,000) acres or 4,048 hectares should be obtained based on the location, relative absence of human settlements within the area and other relevant factors.
FUTO is surrounded by a number of autonomous communities and homesteads all of which had contributed land acquired for the development of the University. These communities are Ihiagwa, Obinze, Umuoma, Nekede, Eziobodo, Avu, Okolochi, Obibiezena, and Emeabiam.

The university recognizes the importance of its location in Dutse and seeks to link its research and teaching to the vast resources of these great metropolitan areas in the surrounding states.

FUD seeks to attract a diverse and international faculty and student body, to support research and teaching on global issues, and to create academic relationships with many universities and higher educational institutions in Nigeria and across the world. It expects all areas of the university to advance knowledge and learning at the highest level and to convey the products of its efforts to the community, the nation, and the world.

As a new federal government-owned institution, FUD offers a broad range of degree programs in the humanities, the natural and social sciences, and agriculture, in years to come, courses in management sciences, environmental studies, law, education, engineering, and medicine. FUD’s pioneer student body will be about 265 undergraduates. As a new university, it is committed to the best tradition of excellence. It aspires to be a teaching and research-intensive, technologically driven institution. FUD hopes to attract distinguished nationally and internationally known researchers, authors, scientists and scholars, and other fellows and members of professional associations and academies who might help disseminate its vision of higher education, knowledge, and service."," Dutse, Jigawa State",https://www.fud.edu.ng/,{},17,FUD,registrar@fud.edu.ng,,3,"{https://businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Federal-University-Dutse-1.png, https://schoolings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NUC-Accredits-37-Courses-in-FUD.jpg, https://nigerianscholars.com/assets/uploads/2016/01/federal-university-dutse.jpg, https://sps.fud.edu.ng/assets/images/img2.jpg, https://29mlysy18zp3a414l1wttxrb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/20191010_123228-min.jpg}",2011
