With the establishment of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, in 1962, it was renamed Abdullahi Bayero College. In 1964 it moved to a temporary site at the old Kano Airport Hotel, admitting its first set of ten undergraduate students for a B.A. degree programme of Ahmadu Bello University.
This first set graduated in 1966 but it continued as a faculty of ABU until 1980. Before then the temporary site had attracted hostile fire during the civil war and had to move to its permanent site (present old campus) in the vicinity of Kabuga and Dukawuya gates on the Kano-Gwarzo road. The next phase of development occurred in 1975, when Abdullahi Bayero College was raised to the status of a University College with the right to award degrees on behalf of Ahmadu Bello University and was renamed Abdullahi Bayero University College, with its own Governing Council.
All University Colleges in the country were raised to the status of fullfledged universities in 1977 by the Federal Government and Abdullahi Bayero University College became Bayero University, Kano (BUK) (backed by the promulgation of BUK Decree no 79 of 1979). Dr. Mahmud Tukur, the Principal of the University College became its pioneer Vice-Chancellor (1977-78) leading the team that laid the foundation and initiated the process that gave rise to the present permanent site and the shape of the university as we know it today.

It is a learning and research institution that seeks to solve immediate needs of the society and give every person the opportunity to acquire knowledge.
The university was established in 2013 by President Goodluck Jonathan. This was done to give every state of Nigeria (those without a federal university) access to higher education and to give all states equal access to education. Yobe State is listed as one of the educationally disadvantaged with low enrollment in schools and high rate of illiteracy.
In its Education Sector reform and development, the Federal Government of Nigeria, in 2010, approved the establishment of twelve (12) universities in the six geopolitical zones of the country. This was to expand access to tertiary education for Nigerians. For effective take off of the universities, an Implementation Committee which includes National Universities Commission (NUC), the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) and other relevant stakeholders was constituted. The Committee held consultations with governors of the states for the new universities and inspected the proposed sites before submitting its report on 15 November 2010. The implementation of the committee''s report was in phases. The implementation of the first phase started with the establishment of nine Universities, in February 2011. The implementation of the second phase involved the establishment of three Universities including the FUGashua in February 2013. On 18 February 2013, Prof. Shehu Abdul Rahaman was appointed Vice-Chancellor, and Sulu Dauda, Registrar (pioneers). In June 2015, FUGashua matriculated its 240 pioneer students. Three years after the maiden matriculation, student population grew significantly, and in February 2018, 990 students were matriculated.

In August 2003 the University Council formalized the Centre for Climate Change and Freshwater Resources (CCCFR) as one of three newly established Centres. The others are Centre for Human Settlements and Urban Development (CHSUD) and Centre for Remedial and Extra-mural Studies (CRES). The CCCFR in collaboration with environmentalists in the six Geopolitical Zones of Nigeria have just concluded a N105 million National Agro-Climatic Atlas Project to combat effects of climate change-induced natural disaster in Nigeria sponsored by the Ecological Fund Office of the Presidency. The second phase of the project is awaiting Federal Executive Councilâ€™s approval. Aart from this project, the Centre is now into collaborative climate change studies with University of Cape Town, South Africa, while its scientists continue as consulting experts with United Nations Agencies like UNFCCC, WMO, UNEP, UNDP, FAO, UNESCO etc. The Centre is also involved in the universityâ€™s Sustainable Livelihood initiative in the context of the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2015) and is about to commence a new professional programme in Climate Change Disaster Risk Assessment and Risk Reduction as a prelude to a programme in Disaster Early Warning.
The Centre for Human Settlements and Urban Development (CHSUD) which was established by the University in collaboration with the UN-Habitat is to assist in settlements, Urban Governance and Urban Development. Since then, CHSUD has focused attention on building capacity at all levels of government, for effective Urban Environmental Management such as establishment of Environmental Management Information System, Certificate and Postgraduate Diploma Programmes in Public-Private Partnership for Urban Environment. With the support of the Collaborative Learning Course established by a partnership of UNDP and Yale University, U.S.A. CHSUD is currently carrying out consultancy service for UN-Habitat, in four Nigerian cities (Ibadan, Enugu, Kano and Karu) on the use of implementation instruments for sustainable cities programme. In its effort to contribute to the development of manpower for urban environmental management in Nigeria, CHSUD is in the process of designing post-graduate courses (M.Sc. and Ph.D) in City Planning and Urban Design, with the support of UN-Habitat.
The Centre for Remedial and Extra-Mural Studies (CRES) is responsible for coordination of all academic programmes not funded by the National Universities Commission (NUC). Remedial course is a one-year terminal programme specifically designed to equip candidates from catchment areas with emphasis on Niger State, who are deficient in some basic science subjects and are unable to meet UME admission requirements. Admission into this programme is also extended to other thirty-six states of the federation and FCT. On successful completion of Remedial programme, students secure admission into the various degree programmes run by the University. Approval has also been given to the Centre to commence Diploma and Certificate programmes.
More recently in August 2006, the Centre for Research and Development in Information Technology (CREDIT) was established. This latest Centre is not only to make Federal University of Technology, Minna, ICT compliant but also to launch the University into the global market of certified software development.

Although the idea of the Polytechnic was originally conceived by Brigadier Harris Eghagha, the government of Chief Olabisi Onabanjo saw it through. Thus, the defunct House of Assembly enacted the act cited as “the Ogun State Polytechnic Act No. 8 of 1980”, which provided for the Establishment, Incorporation, Constitution and functions of the Institution.
Consequently, academic activities began with a student population of 220, 29 academic staff and 5 senior administrative officers at its initial temporary sites at Oke-Egunya and Onikolobo both in Abeokuta. The Institution formally moved to its permanent site at Ojere in 1985 where it occupies 959 hectares of land. 
Following the death of Chief MKO Abiola, the Polytechnic’s greatest benefactor in 1998, the Institution was renamed Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, Abeokuta. As a result of this, the law of the Polytechnic was repealed and a new law cited as Moshood Abiola Polytechnic Edict of May 1999 was thereafter enacted.

It became the first of three such Universities set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria who sought to establish a University of Technology in each geo-political region and particularly in a State which did not have a conventional University.
On November 28, 1980, in the premises of the Old Government Technical College (GTC), FUTO opened its doors to staff and students.
In January 1982 the Imo State government approved a permanent site for the University.  FUTO engaged Messrs Concarplan â€“ Enplan Group (a firm of Consultants) to design the physical plan for the University. Located 25 kilometers south of Owerri, the selection of the site was guided by the advice of the National Universities Commission that a minimum area of ten thousand (10,000) acres or 4,048 hectares should be obtained based on the location, relative absence of human settlements within the area and other relevant factors.
FUTO is surrounded by a number of autonomous communities and homesteads all of which had contributed land acquired for the development of the University.

The university is located in Akungba Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria. Adekunle Ajasin University was first established as Obafemi Awolowo University in March 1982 by the government of the old Ondo State, headed by the late Chief Michael Adekunle Ajasin. The immediately succeeding military government of Navy Commodore Michael Bamidele Otiko changed its name to Ondo State University in 1985. Its relocation to Akungba Akoko in the new Ondo State became imperative in 1999, following the creation of a new state out of the old Ondo three years earlier in October 1996. The bill backing the relocation was signed into law by the then Governor of the State, Chief Adebayo Adefarati, in November 1999, and that prompted the movement of a crop of workers from the old site in Ado-Ekiti to Akungba Akoko on 1 December 1999. The bill for yet another name change, this time to Adekunle Ajasin University, in order to immortalise the late Governor Ajasin, was signed into law by Governor Adefarati in 2004 following the demise of the former. The amended and subsisting statute of the university was signed into law in November 2007 by yet another governor, the former Governor Olusegun Agagu. In these circumstances, it can rightly be said that while the history of AAUA started in 1982, its relocation on 5 November 1999 marked the beginning of the second phase of its history now in its present location, Akungba Akoko. Adekunle Ajasin University offers undergraduate and post-graduate as well as Pre-degree, JUPEB programmes in fields of specialization ranging from Science, Arts, Education, Law, Social and Management sciences, Agricultural science, Environmental Design and Management.

The university has seven (7) faculties .

The main campus is located at Ikot Akpaden, Mkpat Enin Local Government Area. It adjoins the confluence of Ikot Akpaden - Eastern Obolo road and Eket - Ikot Abasi highway. This highway runs across the Niger Delta from Calabar in the East through Eket, Ikot Abasi, Port Harcourt, Warri and Benin, to Lagos on the Western coast of the country. 
The Main Campus at Mkpat Enin extends from the East-West Highway to the Atlantic Ocean shoreline, totaling about 4,600 hectares, with 180 hectares of gently rolling, well-drained tableland which provides the high ground that is ideal for the physical development of the University. The rest of the southern part is a degraded wetland - water-logged and flooded with mangrove swamp and tidal creeks. The Main Campus stretches over a distance of 12km from the highway to the shoreline and is 4km wide.
The Obio Akpa Campus is the second site, meant for the Faculties of Agriculture, Social and Management Sciences. The campus has a sub-urban setting, adjoining Abak town and is within 15 minutes'' drive from Uyo. Its topography is undulatory with gentle hills and slopes which gives it a unique scene.
The first phase of the Main Campus occupies an area of about 7 hectres. There are academic blocks for lectures, laboratories, engineering workshops, a large central cafeteria for 500 students, and an auditorium of similar capacity, a library building (with e - book library sections), male and female hostels, a medical Centre and a sports arena. This campus has about 2km of tarred road network with concrete sidewalks and effective drainage.

Electricity is provided by both the public electricity supply (PHCN) and 2 No. 500KVA standby generators. A mini water works of 100,000 litres serviced by 2 No. water boreholes provides the water needs of the campus.
The Obio Akpa Campus, being an old site of a tertiary institution, already has roads that were paved since the 1950s when the campus began as a British colonial agricultural experimental station. Buildings already exist to be used by the Faculties of Agriculture and Management Sciences. There are academic, administrative blocks and laboratories. It also has large demonstration farms for palm oil, rubber, fisheries, and small/large ruminants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The next campus is located at Obio Akpa, Oruk Anam Local Government Area, along Abak - Ikot Okoro Road. The goals of the university have been modified by the administration of the State Government in order to transform the university into a conventional university whose focus is not just Technology and Applied Science but also Arts. In line with this transformation, the name of the institution has been changed from Akwa Ibom State University of Technology to Akwa Ibom State University.

It has its permanent site in Igbariam in Anambra East local government area under the Anambra North Senatorial District.  The campuses in Uli and Igbariam have libraries that provide e-resources and reference services to the students, staff and the members of the academic community. Anambra State University of Science and Technology, (as it was then called) was established by law No. 13 of 2000 by the Anambra State Government. The University was conceived a 2-Campus structure with the main campus of the University located at Uli in the former site of the Ekwenugo Okeke Polytechnic, formally called Anambra state Polytechnic and the second campus located at Igbariam in the former site of the College of Agriculture. The law establishing the University phased out the State Polytechnic and the University inherited its assets and liabilities. On the other hand, the University law failed to repeal the Edict establishing the College of Agriculture, Igbariam, hence, legally, the University and the College existed side by side at the Igbariam Campus site, until 2006 when the government relocated the College of Agriculture to Mgbakwu, about fifteen kilometers away from Igbariam.

By the Anambra State University Amendment Law No. ANHA/LAW/2006/01 of 26th January, 2006, the name of the University was changed to Anambra State University in keeping with the Visitation Report of 2004 recommendation that the University should revert to a conventional University. The Amendment Law of 2006 provided for a 3 – Campus structure for the University comprising:

Uli Campus
(i) Faculty of Engineering

(ii) Faculty of Environmental Sciences

(iii) Faculty of Science

(iv) Pre-Science Programme

Igbariam Campus
(i) Faculty of Agriculture

(ii) Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences

Alor Campus
(i) Faculty of Law

(ii) Faculty of Management Sciences

(iii) College of Health Sciences

(iv)  University Teaching Hospital

The 2006 Amendment Law also provided that Alor Campus would house the University Administrative Headquarters because of its centrality to the other Campuses. However, Alor Campus did not take off, even though the enabling law prescribed its establishment. Meanwhile, the two Faculties of Law and Management Sciences are located at Igbariam Campus of the University. However, in 2010 the College of Medicine and Teaching Hospital being constructed at Amaku General Hospital, Awka received legal backing as the state House of Assembly passed an amendment act to situate a third campus of the University a three campus structure at Uli (Anambra South), Awka (Anambra Central) and Igbariam (Anambra North).

The University Pre-Science Programme, which in 2008, was relocated to Uli Campus, is waxing stronger. So also is the Part-Time/Weekend Degree Programme at the Igbariam Campus.

The University shall commence new programmes in the following areas in next academic year:

Music, Philosophy and Religion / Society in the faculty of Arts.

Sociology and Psychology in the faculty of Social Sciences.

Urban and Regional Planning in the faculty of Environmental Sciences.

Towards this end, Senate has approved the de-merging of faculty of Environmental Sciences from the faculty of Engineering at Uli Campus and the de-merging of faculty of Arts from faculty of Social Sciences at Igbariam Campus.

It is noteworthy that this University is one of the institutions, the Nigerian Security and Exchange Commission is assisting in the establishment of the programme in Capital Market Studies. This programme is being housed in the Faculty of Management Sciences at the Igbariam Campus.

It is pertinent to point out that programmes in Medicine (i.e. Pre-Med. and Pre-Clinical), based at Uli Campus, commenced in 2008/2009 academic year. The National Universities Commission visited these medical programmes on resource verification in 2011 and the results were favourable and successful.

With respect to the Clinical Programmes of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery based at Awka using the structures and facilities of the former Amaku-General Hospital, the Government of Anambra State has just constructed multi-million naira physical structures to accommodate the Clinical Programmes of the Medical School as well as its Teaching Hospital Professional bodies accreditation

The University has not fared badly in the professional bodies’ accreditation visits. So far, it had received full and interim accreditation from the following professional bodies.

Council for Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN); with respect to Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering (full accreditation), while Chemical Engineering and Electrical Engineering received interim accreditation.

Council of Legal Education; in respect of the University’s Law programmes (interim accreditation). Another accreditation visit by Council of Legal Education is slated for 15th-17th November, 2009.

The creation of Enugu State out of Anambra State in 1991 by the then Military President General Ibrahim Gbadamasi Babangida,transformed ASUTECH into Enugu State University of Science and Technology.                           It is with delight that I welcome you to the Enugu State University of Science and Technology, a top-ranking University of Technology in Nigeria and indeed the nation’s technological pride. Established in 1980 as the very first state University, the University has grown tremendously, stretching its academic disciplines and research across six different Schools and thirty academic departments. ESUT is located at Agbani in Enugu State, Nigeria and its vision and mission are not only clearly stated, but very vigorously pursued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The University was established as a non residential multi-campus institution. On establishment, the University which was conceived on a Presidential model after Harvard University made impressive landmarks and stamped its name as the first University of Technology and first State University in Nigeria with her main campus at Enugu. Other campuses that were created later were located at Abakiliki, Awka and Nnewi. At inception, only three faculties namely, Engineering, Science and Technology were established at the two functional campuses at Enugu and Awka.

In 1985, there were major re-organisations and policies resulting in the introduction of new programmes and the merging of the University with its sister polytechnic – IMT. The new faculties created then were faculties of Education, Environmental Sciences, Health Sciences, Law, Social Sciences, Management Sciences and Agric Sciences etc.

The two merged institutions operated unsuccessfully under one Interim Joint Council (IJC) with Prof. Onwumechili as the President and Proc. J.C. Ene of IMT as Deputy until December 1986 when it was demerged.

By 1987 the four campuses had kicked off in earnest with Abakaliki campus housing Agric Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, while Awka campus was for students of Basic Applied Sciences, Law and Social Sciences, Nnewi campus catered for Health Sciences comprising Medicine and Dentistry while the main campus in Enugu housed Engineering, Technology, Management Sciences and the rest. Each of the campuses had a Deputy Vice-Chancellor as the administrative head.

In 1991, following the creation of Enugu State from the old Anambra State the new Government changed name from ASUTECH to ESUT.

At that time, the two former campuses of ASUTECH at Awka and Nnewi became the State University for Anambra State which today has been taken over by the Federal Government and renamed Nnamdi Azikiwe University, while the Enugu and Abakiliki campuses on the other hand formed ESUT.

ESUT however retained and adopted all the identities of the old ASUTECH including its main campus, the logo, colour, anthem, philosophy, aims and objectives among others.

This re-packaged University, ESUT, established a new campus at Adada Nkpologwu in Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area where students of Applied Natural Sciences and Social Sciences were located.

These three campuses at Enugu, Abakailiki and Nsukka Zones of the State had four colleges, each headed by a Provost.

College of Engineering at Enugu
College of Agriculture at Abakaliki
College of Applied Natural Sciences at Adada –Nsukka
College of Health Sciences at Abakaliki
The creation of Ebonyi State from the old Enugu and Abia States in 1996 saw ESUT forfeiting its campus at Abakaliki which houses its Colleges of Medicine and Agriculture. The new State (Ebonyi) understandably converted the campuses to a State University known today as (EBSU) Ebonyi State University. ESUT on the other hand re-established its College of Health Sciences at Nsukka until 2005 when it was relocated to Parklane Enugu and named ESUT College of Medicine/Teaching Hospital.

On February 14, 2006, the University under the Vice Chancellorship of Prof. Ikechukwu Chidobem was moved from its temporary site at Independence Layout Enugu to a befitting permanent structure built in Nkanu West L.G.A. and named Ebeano City."," Enugu, Enugu State",https://www.esut.edu.ng,{},14,ESUST,info@esut.edu.ng,8113693805,2,"{https://i0.wp.com/theeasterner.com.ng/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/esut_medical_hostel_1.jpg,https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/11694674_1684292esut9jpeg4b1aad01f6531565344c90b82f2c212a_jpegf8ffacec66c35cfe1f37f74215542215,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRftVGf9lGtpqTSyjkV-8UBQuQ9RGn9-vyfuvh5bY0CJBGwNJeeVoLhn-1jQ5fuxX60oBU&usqp=CAU,https://esutfinance.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/law.jpg,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Enugu-State-University-Teaching-Hospital-640x360.jpg}",1982

The College was established out of the need to check the acute shortage of trained teachers for the rapidly expanding programmes of post-primary education in Rivers State after the civil war in 1970.

However, it was upgraded to Rivers State College of Education in 1975 following the promulgation of Edict No 1 on  25th February 1975. Following this transformation, Mr Emmanuel Aguma, who was appointed Principal in January 1975 became the first Provost of the new College.

The College had its first graduation ceremony on 11th March 1978 where four sets of students totalling 462 received the Nigeria Certificate in Education.

In1982, the College admitted the first candidates for the Bachelor of Education degree programme in affiliation with the University of Ibadan.

It is noteworthy that of all the Colleges of Education affiliated with the University of Ibadan, the then Rivers State College of Education was the only one that offered the Bachelor of Education degree programme.

However, to actualise the vision of the founding fathers of the College to become an autonomous degree-awarding institution, it was again upgraded to a University following the passage of the University of Education Law No. 8 of 2009 by the Rivers State House of Assembly on 15 October 2009.

The official pronouncement was made on October 20, 2009, by His Excellency, Rotimi Chibike Amaechi, the governor of Rivers State, but was renamed Ignatius Ajuru University of Education in 2010 in honour of the late Ambassador Ignatius Ajuru, a one-time Chairman of the institution’s Governing Council, who championed the upgrading of the College to a University.

The institution is the thirty-fifth (35th) state-owned University in Nigeria.

The University has three campuses located in Rumuolumeni (the main campus and seat of administration), St John Diobu campus, and Ndele campus in Obio/Akpor, Port Harcourt, and Emuoha Local Government Areas respectively.

Currently, the University has seven Faculties. They are the Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Humanities, Faculty of Management Sciences, Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences, Faculty of Social Sciences and Faculty of Vocational and Technical Education.

There are fifty (50) teaching departments, seventy-four (74) Prof.s, and other teaching staff.

The majority of the Programmes of the institution are fully accredited by the National Universities Commission (NUC), Nigeria’s Universities regulatory body.

This was made possible by the Visitor to the University and the Rivers State Governor, His Excellency, Barrister Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, whose love for youth development and quality education is unquestionable.","Rumuolumeni, Rivers State",https://www.iaue.edu.ng,{},32,IAUE,info@iaue.edu.ng,9035634858,2,"{https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Main_Gate%2C_Ignatius_Ajuru_UOE.jpg/800px-Main_Gate%2C_Ignatius_Ajuru_UOE.jpg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Faculty_of_Education%2C_Ignatius_Ajuru_UOE.jpg/1280px-Faculty_of_Education%2C_Ignatius_Ajuru_UOE.jpg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Patience_Goodluck_Jonathan_Library%2C_IAUOE.jpg/800px-Patience_Goodluck_Jonathan_Library%2C_IAUOE.jpg,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhcbfEX88qIkQYYshgQu0kp99qDmQDo0l-QJJO=w1080-h608-p-no-v0,https://estmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/UOE-EST-Master.jpg}",2010

The recognition of the importance of university education for rapid and sustainable socio-economic development and the absence of a federal university in the State prompted the decision to establish the university. The State had many qualified candidates who could not be admitted into existing universities.
Under the leadership of Chief Sam Mbakwe, the Imo State Government sought and obtained the approval of the Federal Government to establish the university as a liberal studies tertiary institution. The university was initially located in Uturu but was relocated to Owerri in 1992 after the creation of Abia State.
Imo State University is committed to educational development and has played a pivotal role in providing university education for its citizens. A desire for progress and development drives the thirst for knowledge in Imo State, and this forms the basis for the university''s vision, mission, philosophy, and objectives.
The university is responsible for producing manpower to accelerate national development and ensure that the Imo people are competitive in the Niger Delta oil-producing area of Nigeria. The university shares this responsibility with the federal university located in the State. As the number of applicants continues to increase, the university must maintain its focus on excellence and quality.
To achieve this goal, the university has developed its mission, vision, and objectives in line with the principles outlined in its strategic plans for 2004-2007, 2012-2015, and 2016-2020.                                                                                                                                        IMSU operates a faculty system and has 15 faculties. The faculties are headed by Deans and Faculty Officers. The Faculties have different departments under them. The Departments are headed by the Heads of Departments (HODs) who are under the Dean of the Faculties. The lecturers, the Heads of Departments, and the Deans make up the Faculty Board. They are all academic members of the university, governed by Academic Staff Union of the University (ASUU). The academic staff is responsible for the curriculum and teaching of the students. They teach, set exams, mark scripts, and supervise projects.

Imo state University also runs Post Graduate (PG) Programme for those who want to build on their First Degree Programme.

This new and rising University will offer to the students, the community, the nation, and the global community a fresh, vibrant, and academic environment, built on the best traditions of knowledge and service and in which there is an indivisible link between knowledge, technology, and service on the one hand and human progress and development on the other.

The Sule Lamido University, Kafin Hausa (SLU) was founded by the Jigawa State Government on May 13, 2013. It was licensed by the Federal Government of Nigeria through the National Universities Commission (NUC) as the 39th State University in Nigeria and the 129th in the Nigerian University System. The University is located in the Kafin Hausa town, a rapidly growing cosmopolitan centre, which is also the headquarters of the Kafin Hausa local government area.

The University is about one and half hours drive from Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA), Kano.

As a new University, SLU will strive to be a citadel of knowledge devoted to local, national, and global development. The University will serve the critical needs of the catchment area, the community, the nation, and the world as a whole. The University will seek to be a top class university based on the best traditions of academic research and service excellence, so that it becomes, with time, a magnet to scholars and researchers. This means the University will develop the potentials of the individual and the society by building excellent academic and research facilities, including ICT resources all of which will contribute to the creation of the most serene environment for research and learning within the University.

SLU is poised to attract a diverse and international cast of scholars and student body, support sound research and teaching on local and global issues, and to create academic relationships with many universities and higher education institutions in Nigeria and across the world. It expects all areas of the University to advance knowledge and learning at the highest level and to produce graduates that are imbued with entrepreneurial skills so that they will be able to contribute to the development of the community, the nation, and the world.

Overall, then, the vision of SLU is to be a university with a strong tradition of excellence, intellectual progress, and continuing learning and service; a university driven by the new demands of globalization, rapid advances in technology, environmental issues, and other societal challenges.

I invite you, through this website, to gain the most from SLU’s wide-ranging academic offerings, and its commitment to active, discovery learning, a signature feature of a SLU education—one that you should take advantage of by starting your undergraduate studies in this promising University.

The university was founded on 7 July 1982 as Ogun State University (OSU) and was renamed Olabisi Onabanjo University on 29 May 2001, in honour of Chief (Dr.) Olabisi Onabanjo, whose efforts as the then civilian governor of Ogun State gave birth to the university. Meanwhile, many students still refer to the institution as OSU, an acronym for the former name.

It was ranked the ‘Best State University’ out of a total of 57 in Nigeria in 2016; and currently the 17th out of 279 Higher Education Institutions in Nigeria, in terms of web visibility.
The current ranking of our academic programmes, based on the accreditation of programmes in 2020 and 2021, places the University higher in professional programmes such as Medicine, Law, Accounting, Banking and Finance, Economics, Engineering, Architecture, amongst others, than similar programmes in most of the Universities in Nigeria. In fact, all our 75 academic programmes were accredited by the National Universities Commission (NUC). This possibly explains why the University’s programmes at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels are highly sought after by candidates from across the nation.
Our giant strides in the deployment of ICT to advance effective service delivery in terms of teaching and learning are exceptional. It is on record that the University was the first to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to conduct screening examinations for candidates seeking admission into the University. With our huge acquisition of ICT infrastructure, the NUC has just approved the commencement of the university’s Open and Distance Learning Programme, which also promises to give a world-class experience to students enrolled in the programme.

Our unique selling proposition is our formula 1-2-8 (1st in Nigeria, 2nd Africa and 8th in the World) and the first and only university in the country established on solid principles and platform. The Tai Solarin University of Education is a state university of education in Nigeria. It was established in 2005. It is located in Ijagun, Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State.                                                                                                                   The university was named after the Nigerian educational administrator and human rights activist Tai Solarin (1922–1994). It is the 76th approved university in Nigeria. The Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED, pronounced TARSUD), was proclaimed a full-fledged university (and a transformation of the erstwhile Tai Solarin College of Education, established January 1978), on 29 January 2005 by the administration of Otunba Gbenga Daniel.

TASUED was officially approved as a university by the National Universities Commission (NUC) on Tuesday 28 November 2005. It is a citadel of learning dedicated to the production of competent professional educators and teachers who have immense knowledge of their chosen subjects/disciplines of study and the requisite pedagogical skills of subject delivery. The University is unique in that, from inception, it incorporated a four-year mandatory vocational and entrepreneurial study into the curriculum of its B.Ed, B.Sc(Ed),B.Sc and B.A (Ed) programmes such that students are awarded two certificates at graduation; one in their chosen course of study and the other a proficiency certificate in the vocational and entrepreneurial study. Furthermore, a sequel to the NUC Resource Assessment exercise in April 2019, the Commission in addition to the existing programmes (undergraduate and postgraduate) granted the university the approval to establish some postgraduate programmes and the full-time mode of some undergraduate programmes. In all, 59 programmes were newly approved: 33 PhD programmes, 13 M.A, M.Sc, M.A(Ed) and M.Sc(Ed) programmes and 13 B.A and B.Sc programmes.

Umaru Musa Yar''adua, then the executive governor of Katsina State and later the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, began the work of creating the university before his death in 2010.

The law establishing the Katsina State University was passed by the Katsina State House of Assembly on 5 September 2006, and the University commenced academic activities in January 2007 with three faculties (Education, Humanities, and Natural and Applied Sciences), and 16 undergraduate programmes. The State House of Assembly passed a law changing the name of the university to honor Umaru Musa Yar''adua on 8 April 2009.

The first 25 years of the university''s existence have been divided into four phases—three phases of 5 years each, followed by a 10-year phase. In each phase, the university will add faculties, departments, and academic programmes, until it has a total of 13 faculties, 76 departments and 236 academic programmes (undergraduate and postgraduate).

The Visitor of the University is the serving governor of the state (currently Aminu Bello Masari); the Chancellor is Nigeria''s one-time Minister of Economic Development, Dr. Umaru Mutallab; and the current Vice Chancellor (as of 2021) is Prof. Sanusi Mamman.

Our main campus is located in Osogbo, the capital of the State of Osun, while our other campuses are located in five other towns ( Ejigbo, Ifetedo, Ikire, Ipetu-Ijesa and Okuku) spread across the six geopolitical zones of the State. Licensed on 21 December, 2006, we opened our doors to full academic activities on 21 September 2007 and we have continued to make steady progress in the development of facilities and human resource to match the growing needs of the institution.

At Osun State University, we are driven by our vision and desire to “be a centre of excellence providing high quality teaching and learning experience, which will engender the production of entrepreneurial graduates capable of impacting on their environment while being globally competitive.” As an institution, we have committed ourselves to creating “a unique institution committed to the pursuit of academic innovation, skill-based training and a tradition of excellence in teaching, research and community service.”

The UNIOSUN, as we are fondly called, was not set up simply to add to the number of institutions dotting the higher educational landscape of Nigeria. Rather, the University was established to meet a felt need for a higher institution that will make significant difference in addressing the challenges confronting the higher education sector in our country and continent at large. These include the problems of access, quality, funding and relevance.

We are continually making available spaces for thousands of would-be undergraduates while providing quality instruction with curricula that address the critical needs of the society in the 21st century. Our funding model is novel in the sense that it provides for cost sharing between the proprietors (i.e. the State Government), the people of Osun State at large through the contribution from all the Local Governments in the State, and the beneficiaries who contribute their quota through the modest tuition paid. This has enabled the development of a body of stakeholders committed to the success of this project.

With the approval by the National Universities Commission (NUC) of our Postgraduate School in June, 2014, we have commenced admissions into our higher degree and postgraduate diploma programmes. We are therefore set to contribute even more to our country’s quest for quality human resource."," Osogbo, Osun State",https://www.uniosun.edu.ng,{},29,OSU,admissions@uniosun.edu.ng,8107976419,2,"{https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Osun-State-University-Osogbo-scaled.jpg,https://www.uniosun.edu.ng/cache/resized/9b70a55fc9e14c74ea52b0a71d3b3f95.jpg,https://www.uniosun.edu.ng/cache/resized/6dd29c615c1dd08a4a939d33f0b1a9d7.jpg,https://www.uniosun.edu.ng/cache/resized/afed5abac16c8901dc784bad157f19b5.jpg,https://m.timbu.com/poi/1462/uniosun3-1462-57b27d328453b.}",2006

Ali Modu Sheriff which was actualized by Honorable Kashim Shettima, the former Executive Governor of Borno State. The Government clearly expressed its determination to provide sound and qualitative education in the state. It aimed at establishing a good tertiary institution for thousands of our Senior Secondary School Certificate holders at a time of stiff competition for admissions into institutions of higher learning to which Borno State is a catchment area and host community.

Appreciating the fact that the present number of Universities in the country can hardly accommodate more than 20% of the total number of candidates seeking admissions each year, particularly Borno State indigenes who have met the requirements for admission into universities were left roaming the streets, largely due to inadequate spaces in the existing universities. This situation readily called for the need to establish a state owned University in Borno State.

Senator Ali Modu Sheriff went further to constitute a Technical Committee for the establishment of the Borno State University, in Maiduguri under the Chairmanship of Prof. Muhammad Nur Alkali. Hon. Kashim Shettima actualized the establishment of the Borno State University, by first signing the bill into law in 2012.  He reactivated the Technical Committee after the demise of Prof. Mohammed Nur Alkali, with Prof. Abubakar Mustapha as Chairman in 2016.  The University thereafter got its oparations approved by NUC in 2016. Hon Kashim Shettima in line with the Borno State University Law sought the approval of the Executive Council for the appointment of Principal Officers of the University with Prof. Umar Kyari Sandabe as the pioneer Vice-Chancellor in March, 2019.  Armed with a prepared Academic Brief, the Law establishing the University and the Master Plan, the NUC approved by the establishment of The University planned for a twenty five (25) year period and provides the details of the Vision, Mission, Philosophy Objectives, Administrative structure and Research Policy for the University. The brief captures the Faculties, Departments and courses that the University shall offer at inception and its full maturity over a twenty five year period. It also captures the number of staff and students that shall populate the University in the first ten (10) years of its existence as well as the resources required to run the University during the same period."," Maiduguri,  Borno State",http://www.bosu.edu.ng/,{},8,BSU,info@bosu.edu.ng,7014449880,2,"{https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMu-ezGix9yxa29CE2sgi9-sTCkbKCCPUA_UeWt=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCc_OKovTsRmsgxF8dN6AeIvPY_VTFE7Txqwgt=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIX1s-N3w3zwYW8qYzf4iVOc6LLnVLrkU5d6pL=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnPr7_swLUmoDU2pktgAxbmsSavfFfjLm_Hn4V=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6AUZeJoBJ7azNWx-PumCDyba97oqic0oK2ATo=s680-w680-h510}",2016

To make KOMU famous for producing talented men and women with passion and skills to apply knowledge and technology sensibly to solve the problems of the nation and the global community at large.
At the core of this mission is our firm desire to educate future leaders not just to acquire requisite knowledge and various life survival skills, but leaders with deep passion for humanity in the discharge of their civic responsibilities for the good of society i.e. “developing the complete man – soul, body and divinity”

UAT, a State university with a strong focus on “internationalisation” represents a new way of providing and managing higher education, combining the
benefits of strong State support with private sector entrepreneurial thinking.

Its commitment to internationalisation is amply reflected in its curricular structure, partnerships with carefully selected
institutions in other parts of the world and the composition of both its faculty and students.

Its small but growing contingent of highly qualified faculty, drawn from various parts of the world is a strong indication that it is seriously committed to its major to not be a university for students drawn from a specific region or population group but to rebuild the international stature previously enjoyed by some of the old universities on the continent and to attract both staff and students from diverse backgrounds. To that end, nothing has been spared in ensuring that we also provide a first-class, modern living and working environment for all who are part of this young institution.

To ensure that the academic engagement of our students takes place at a level consistent with international standards, all first year studies include a “foundation” component, designed to enhance their competencies in numeracy, use of new learning technologies and communication skills, as well as some important basic life-skills widely found to be missing from many graduates from universities within our region.

While the university already enjoys approval for a wide range of degree programs, including Business, Education, Engineering, Health Sciences and Law, because of its location in an area that enjoys a high level of production of a wide variety of agricultural products, its Faculty of Agriculture is destined to become a flagship program designed to strengthen that sector of the economy – agriculture, food production and processing. The presence of a cassava-processing plant nearing completion at its doorstep is testimony to the desire to achieve these forward and backward economic linkages. The “UAT Farms Ltd” enterprise is a fully operational commercial farming enterprise which is ratcheting up to supply poultry and poultry products, as well as a range of horticultural products to a number of major institutions and consumer outlets in the region. In addition to creating employment for members of the local community, it is also to serve as a training facility to provide extension services to the local community.

Similarly, the recent establishment of a Centre for Cancer Research is intended to add a strong practical and research element to some of the work expected to come out of our College of Health Sciences and to focus on some of the types of cancers commonly found in this region. Discussions for formal partnerships with selected leading cancer research centers, in the Middle East and the United States, are already at an advanced stage. These partnerships will allow our students and staff access to some of the highly qualified personnel already working there and their facilities, thus again, giving our work an international focus and aiming for international standards while addressing local problems.","Bayelsa, Bayelsa State",https://uat.edu.ng/,{},6,UATO,registrar@uat.edu.ng,7087022222,2,"{https://www.realmina.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/University-of-Africa.jpg,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSmiYxLdnUX9ZB51agDNt_52fyHVoBr3IuQ72DxKDxfoyc-r9DuYKeLq7NrFovXtLgVmzU&usqp=CAU,https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTZPdVSevRb9VybBoio7FsTVzt-0ixDJHoT8lmdkIds2qfb9aw5GoA-CPNkZol-oeyqJKc&usqp=CAU}",2016

The Delta State Polytechnic, Ozoro was established by Law enacted by the Delta State Government on November 12, 2002 during the administration of His Excellency, Chief James Onanefe Ibori. The Polytechnic was one of the four new tertiary institutions established at the same time by the State Government in its desire to meet the yearnings of Deltans for acquisition of qualitative education which was hitherto not being satisfied by institutions owned by the Federal and the State Government.

Furthermore, the history of the defunct Polytechnic will not be complete without mentioning that there was a Polytechnic in Ozoro known as Ozoro Polytechnic established by the defunct Bendel State Government from 1982 - 1985. The Polytechnic was later phased out and after some years (1992 precisely), a College of Agriculture was established. The College of Agriculture operated for approximately ten (10) years before it was finally absorbed into the Delta State Polytechnic, Ozoro in 2003.

Allocating realistic amount of time means effective learning for student and effective teaching for lecturers. How an institution defines time expectations for student, lectures, administrations, and other professional staff can establish the basis for high performances for all. Time on task will be a principle that applies to all person within, and all components of, an institution. The university will therefore consider student time on task (learning), lecturer time on task (teaching), and institutional time on task (devoted to teaching and learning). Student typically will have heavy course-hour requirement, and the University will expect a tremendous amount of work outside class in preparation for each hour. For lecturers, the University will ensure that individual teachers themselves commit sufficient time to the institutional task. Teachers are powerful role model for their student. The simple matter of starting and ending class on time can send important messages about how Prof.s and profession view and use time. Corresponding efforts may be required to ensure the students are timely in their own class attendance.

Al-Hikmah University stands out among Nigerian universities as a conventional private university with a well-articulated mission of promoting both academic and moral excellence for the good of the Nigerian nation in particular and for furthering the course of humanity in general. The overall goal of the University is summed up in its motto: “Learning for Wisdom and Morality”.

The curriculum of our Noble Institution is geared towards promoting academic excellence and also ensuring moral and spiritual uprightness of our youths, most especially in the face of the imposing vicious challenges posed to humanity at large in the wake of the 21st Century. Not only this, we are poised to contribute to the economic growth of the nation through the offering of admission and employment opportunities to all, irrespective of political, social, religious, gender, racial, or ethnic affiliations.

However, there was no tuition centre in Ibadan to teach the remaining eight subjects in Part 2 of the Institute’s examinations, and all Ibadan students had to go to Lagos every weekend for lectures.

Thus a network of the now so-called Nelson Mandela Research Institutes was born. AUST in Abuja was the first of these Centers of Excellence to be established. It currently only offers Graduate level programs by a combination of course work and cutting edge research. AUST draws both students and faculty from all across Africa. Because of the high level of instruction needed for the specialised course work it offers as the foundation for its demanding research at the Master’s and doctoral levels and the quality of research standards it insists on, AUST taps into a now well-established international network of scientists and engineers who serve as visiting faculty. As part of its quality assurance structures, the university draws on the knowledge, experience and wisdom of a global interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers, members of the African Scientific Committee (ASC) and an International Scientific Advisory Board (ISAB). 

While it currently only offers programs by a combination of intensive coursework and research in five disciplinary areas, starting later in 2016, new Master’s level programs, by course work only, will be offered.

The University started as CMS Training Institution in Abeokuta in 1853 from where it was relocated to Lagos (1868 to 1896). In March 1896, it was transplanted to Oyo retrospectively in 1920.
At inception, St. Andrews College, Oyo produced holders of Grade II Teachers Certificate while the Divinity Course for training church ministers was added to the curriculum between 1910 and 1942 and the proprietorship of the College was transferred from CMS, London to the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion). A salient feature in the History of St. Andrews is that it became welded to the church as a snail is inseparably linked with its shell. In 1977 Government took over the control and administration of all schools in the Nigerian Federation and with this development the Church of Nigeria was divested of her Proprietorship of the College. However, the St. Andrews College Old Boys Association (SACOBA) interest and by extension that of the Church, in the growth and development of St. Andrews did not wane. Thus, in response to SACOBA’s petition, the erstwhile Oyo State Government upgraded the Institution to NCE campus in 1980 and to the full fledged College of Education in 1985. The dream of all Andrians (products of St. Andrews College) and their well wishers as well as the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) was that St. Andrews College, Oyo, should ultimately be transformed into a full-fledged University, given her success story and her pioneering role as the Precursor of Tertiary Education in Nigeria. the final step towards fulfilling this dream was taken on 7 September, 1999 when the Church of Nigeria granted SACOBA’s request for the establishment of Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo at the site of the former St. Andrews College, Oyo under the proprietorship of the Church. Having satisfied the rigorous criteria prescribed by the National Universities Commision (NUC) for the establishment of Universities in Nigeria, Ajayi Crowther University (ACU) was granted license to operate as a Private University in Nigeria on 7 January 2005. The University is named after the late Samuel Ajayi Crowther, the first African Bishop who first translated the bible into Yoruba. His Episcopal Ministry covered the entire West African sub-continent."," Oyo Town, Oyo State",https://www.acu.edu.ng,{},30,ACU,admissions@acu.edu.ng,8162707728,1,"{https://www.acu.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SAM_3429.jpg,https://www.acu.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/WhatsApp-Image-2023-05-08-at-6.12.08-PM.jpeg,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgg70M9wk9JFI734OrRpwZ-XpAPgSbbW2YwHys=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8HLcYAsYKCE17s8G2AvyUMUS_PA2pxMzWpCuq=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwU9320fFFitLJXEPK21aXROiw1UvSStHoNzRv=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN4DLLrozRcPaqyluyAlbHJwmzBvEn2Brl-Aaq=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiqXgb_xKeR6JDO0dPNn7VBFcuVzQMkbUkI9w1=s680-w680-h510}",2005

Having first established a private primary and secondary school, ABTI Academy (now AUN Academy) in 2002, His Excellency Atiku Abubakar approached the American University (AU) in Washington, DC, for advice and assistance in establishing an American-style university. That university was licensed as ABTI University in 2003, and the ground was broken for the buildings in October 2004 on the land originally donated by the 11th Lamido Adamawa, the late Alhaji (Dr.) Aliyu Musdafa, CFR. Today, it is seated on more than 2,500 acres.

The renamed ABTI American University of Nigeria set up an outstanding international Board of Trustees, which included Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, Prof. Robert Pastor (1947–2014) from AU, Washington, and a chairman, Ahmed Joda, CFR, a distinguished indigenous technocrat. The first class of students—124 in all—was admitted in the Fall of 2005/Spring 2006. The first President was David Huwiler, PhD.

The institution was conceived as a university which would focus on development issues while providing an education modeled after the best US practices in content and pedagogy. The three constituent schools were Arts & Sciences, Business & Entrepreneurship, and IT & Computing. In 2007, the name of the institution was changed to its present name of American University of Nigeria (AUN). The pioneer class of 92 students graduated in 2009. Every class since then has graduated on schedule.

In 2008, the National Universities Commission (NUC) accredited AUN programs and re-accredited them in 2013. In 2012, AUN launched a graduate program, the Executive Master’s degree in Information Technology. Since then, more programs up to the Ph.D. level have been approved by the NUC.

AUN has its own power station and from its inception has provided 24 hour Internet connection, a unique feat in Nigeria. In 2014, it opened the new Robert A.

Dr. Alfred Adewale Martins nursed the idea of establishing a University. It is worthy of note that the Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos has since 1973 promoted educational development in its territory. This led to the establishment of many primary and secondary schools. In a bid to foster qualitative higher education, the Archdiocese established St. Augustine''s College of Education, Akoka, Yaba, Lagos;  the first privately-owned college of education in Nigeria. In furtherance to this, a decision was taken to establish Augustine University. The University upholds the noble tradition of Catholic Higher Education of achieving intellectual, cultural and moral excellence by preparing students for leadership and enterprise. The University was licensed for take-off on 5th March, 2015 and inaugurated on 23rd October, 2015.

Established by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as a senior college for training church workers from the West African sub-region, ACWA opened  its doors with only seven ministerial students.

By 1966, when it graduated  the first set of Bachelor of Arts degree holders in its own name, enrolment included students taking Business Administration as potential accountants within and outside the Church; and two-year Pre-Nursing students in preparation to pursue a nursing career at the Church’s School of Nursing at Ile-Ife, Osun State. History was made in 1975 when ACWA became the first institution in Nigeria to sign and operate an affiliation agreement with Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan, USA. This relationship enabled it to award Bachelor of Arts degrees from Andrews University in Biology, Business Administration, History, Religion and Secretarial Studies.

1975 was also the year ACWA was renamed Adventist Seminary of West Africa (ASWA) in response to the dynamics of its socio-political environment. In 1983, restricting local factors again necessitated the phasing out of the Bachelors programmes in Biology and Business Administration. In 1988, ASWA reached another academic milestone through an affiliation agreement with the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary of Andrews University, which authorized it to offer Master of Arts in Pastoral Ministry. Master of Arts in Religion was added in 1990 and both programmes were operated during Summer sessions from 1997 to 2007. In order to attain national recognition for its status and programmes, an attempt to obtain  a local affiliation with University of Ibadan, under the name  “Babcock College” was initiated.

The process of affiliation with the University of Ibadan was still in progress when the Federal Government of Nigeria included Babcock University as one of the first three private universities in the country, announced on April 20, 1999. At a public ceremony presided over by the then Honourable Minister of Education, Mr. Sam Olaiya Oni, at the National Universities Commission (NUC), Abuja, on May 10, 1999, the Certificate of Registration No:002 was handed over to BU Pioneer Chancellor and Chairman of the University Council, Pastor Luka T. Daniel in his capacity as the President of the  Africa-Indian Ocean Division of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The Proprietors formally inaugurated the University on June 17, 1999.

The first batch of 1,006 students arrived on September 13, 1999 and their Matriculation Ceremony was presided over by the Visitor to the University, President of the General Conference and world leader of the Seventh-day Adventist Church from Washington, D.C, USA, Pastor/Prof. Jan Paulsen, on January 28, 2000. The University commenced with three faculties (which later became Schools)—Faculty of Education and Humanities, Faculty of Management and Social Sciences, and Faculty of Science and Technology with eleven departments. The School of Law and Security Studies became the fourth School. The 7th graduation on June 07, 2009 marked the 50th Anniversary of the institution, and the 10th Anniversary of the university. The event attracted Federal and State dignitaries, as well as leaders from the World Headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Being a pioneer private University in Nigeria since 1999, Babcock has continued this legacy of upholding a cutting-edge excellence in education. Babcock now has a postgraduate school which took off in the third quarter of 2010 and a medical school which took off in January 2012.","Ilishan-Remo, Osun State",https://www.babcock.edu.ng,{},29,BU,info@babcock.edu.ng,7032049418,1,"{https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZOaWsHcv3NWLHa78TvJaayVXMVTXI7Rh25kI3=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI7-mDnAu6i1IsqswcBGaanwCPOdNE064kinbr=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4X1NfxdzJL43v9To7skb__fzjOGsz6C22mne3=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODPOUfat7VB0EMKFwpkPmdG6MYExXFWm-JsSsr=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXtiFFyqBfWiEm0xgHQMvTEYqKx3uj-UxVOO0-=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPV1X_3oF81CzC8dFiNxnrQDfacmn9l8w6l6j2P=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNupX7Y4W4MohuoHvGnJiMw0jtasQiGr_p0Yd75=s680-w680-h510}",1999

By 1981, the Vision of Christian Faith University (CFU), which was later renamed Benson Idahosa University, had matured in the mind of the Archbishop. But the actualization of the vision had to be suspended to provide room for the establishment of the highly reputable WORD OF FAITH GROUP OF SCHOOLS (Nursery, primary and secondary) in the 1980s.
In 1992, Archbishop Benson Idahosa applied to the Honourable Minister of Education for a licence to establish and operate a private University. Following this development, en expert team of Academics and Professionals was set up to prepare a feasibility report, an Academic Brief and develop a Master Plan for the proposed University. Operating as the institute of continuous learning (ICL), the proposed University organised academic and professional programs for young students.
Christian Faith University became Benson Idahosa University and F.E.B Idahosa became the university’s second president in 1998.

The founders had as a goal, the revitalization of the golden age of high quality and morally sound mission education up to the tertiary level. ECWA leaders and academics of ECWA extraction saw the need to establish a University that will provide a secular education anchored on sound moral values as provided for by the Christian faith. Recognizing the importance of the technological revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries, Bingham University is determined to build a technology-driven institution of the 21st century.

As a means of promoting self-reliance among graduates, the University focuses on entrepreneurial backed education. The University currently runs a total of 64 undergraduate and postgraduate programmes spread across 12 faculties

The University, since its establishment has continued to grow steadily with a current population of over 6,000 students.

That year, the family of the late Rev. Thomas Jefferson Bowen started a school in Ijaiye Orile in the present Oyo State of Nigeria. The School, comprising five stewards of the late Bowens, five other labourers, and a few others drawn to the fledgling school by sheer curiosity, has grown from this little beginning in 1854 into thousands of Baptist Primary and Secondary Schools scattered across the country. By 1960, there was a Baptist school almost everywhere there was found a Baptist congregation.

The idea of establishing a Baptist University in Nigeria was first conceived in 1938. This was borne out of the Baptist commitment to assist the people to develop their potentials to the fullest. The first bold step towards actualising this vision was not taken until 1956 when a proposal was presented to the meeting of the Baptist Mission held in Eku from 11th to 14th December, 1956. On 16th and 17th July, 1957, the joint meeting of the Executive Committees of the Baptist Mission of Nigeria and the Nigerian Baptist Convention endorsed the idea. Since then, the Nigerian Baptist Convention has worked tirelessly, committing time, material and human resources to actualising the vision. Today, all these efforts have crystallised into the establishment of Bowen University, a significant landmark in the academic heritage of the Nigerian Baptist Convention, making it the first Baptist University in Africa.

On 17th of July, 2001, the Federal Government of Nigeria approved the establishment of Bowen University and was subsequently licensed to operate by the National Universities Commission (NUC).

On 4th November, 2002, Bowen University commended academic activities with 506 pioneering students admitted into its three faculties: Agriculture, Science and Science Education, and Social and Management Sciences.

In 2009, the National Universities Commission (NUC) gave approval to the University to offer the degree programmes in Medicine (MBBS), Anatomy (B.Sc) and Physiology (B.Sc). In June 2011, NUC also gave approval to the University to establish the Faculty of Humanities and Faculty of Law. The Faculty of Humanities began immediately in 2012 while the Council of Legal Education sent its own Panel of Facility Visitation inAugust 2012 and gave approval in December the same year. These programmes have commenced in earnest."," Iwo, Osun State",https://www.bowen.edu.ng,{},29,BOWEN,contact@bowen.edu.ng,7000026936,1,"{https://bowen.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sport-1024x683.png,https://www.myschoolgist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bowen-University-Iwo-Osun-State.jpg,https://bowen.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Web-13-1024x683.jpg,https://bowen.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Web-31-1024x683.jpg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Bowen_Worship_Centre.jpg}",2001

The Church realizes that education is a social service which cannot be financed purely on a sustainable basis with students’ fees.
Furthermore, the Church is undertaking the venture, simply because the Church believes that she has a sacred and patriotic duty to lend a helping hand to alleviate the ills which plague all the tiers of educational delivery in the country.
Crawford University is, therefore, a bold attempt by the Church to diversify into the third tier of education. The  effort is geared towards producing graduates with moral excellence, self-confidence, inventive dynamism, and creativity. The Church believes that such graduates will be able to generate for themselves and the society in general, meaningful solutions to unemployment and other pressing manpower needs of the nation.
The West and Central Africa Headquarters situated at Anthony Village, Lagos, is responsible for the administration of all branch churches in the region. Each country, where the church exists, is headed by a country overseer (or District Superintendent). Any country or branch church within the country is financially self supporting.
Crawford University received the operating license from the Federal Government on 9th June, 2005.
Through the help of God, the University was opened to the first batch of students on 30th September, 2005. After one week of orientation, lectures commenced on Monday, 10th October, 2005.

The desire of the Nasrul-Lahi-Il-Fatih Society  (NASFAT) to establish a University was borne out of its educational policy and plan enunciated at its strategic Retreat held at Akodo, Lagos, in the year 2000. From this humble beginning, the Society started a systematic process which led to the hosting of an academic summit of 30 Distinguished Academic Personalities from where an 18-person University Planning Committee emerged in January 2004.

Fountain University was granted an operational licence as a Private University on May 17, 2007 by the Federal Government on the recommendations of the National Universities Commission.Following this achievement, a Fountain Universities Strategic implementation Committee was set up to serve as “in loco Council” to actualise the birth of the University. This Committee worked tirelessly to put in place the necessary facilities for the University to take-off. The Committee was dissolved in September 2007 upon the inauguration of the Governing Council led by Prof. N.O.Adedipe.

The focus is to assist the nation and indeed the continent of Africa in self -discovery so that she may recover her leading position in education and in civilization, as it was in the 20th century.
The goal is to set the pace in making the Nigerian nation fully, competitively and profitably engage her comparative advantage in human and agricultural resource potentials and development.
Nigeria is a country endowed with immense natural resources, ranging from a wide expanse of land to varying degree of solid mineral deposits. In the 1960s, Nigeria was a leading exporter of agricultural produce. But with the oil boom of the 1970s, people’s interest in land cultivation began to wane which culminated in a massive rural-urban migration. By late 1980s, an erstwhile leading agrarian nation was committing a large percentage of its budget to importation of staple foods. This situation continued to increase till date. Although 70% of her population is still involved in agriculture one way or the other, it is at a subsistent level that cannot measure up to a 10th of her food requirement.
Several attempts have been made by successive government to proffer lasting solution from Green Revolution to Operation Feed the Nation, all to no avail. Thus people perpetually go hungry in the midst of abundance.
The above scenario propelled by vision spurred Dr. David O. Oyedepo, the President of Living Faith Church World Wide, to lead the establishment of Landmark University as a catalyst for Agrarian Revolution. Essentially, it is committed to “raising a new generation of solution providers through the covenant channels of inspiration; an army of young people who will be committed to solving local problems and by extension commanding global influence
The proprietors being faith-based, with credible proofs of capacity, are committed to this project by qualitatively contributing to the development of Nigeria’s human resource capacity by making quality education available to qualified citizen of the world irrespective of sex, tribe or nationality.
Landmark University was established to make landmark contributions to knowledge in order to secure increased comfort for humanity by “Breaking New Grounds” in teaching, research and community service as she engages the strategy of promoting collaboration between related disciplines as a conventional university.
On March 7, 2011, the University was licensed by National Universities Commission (NUC) to run undergraduate programs in the Colleges of Agricultural Sciences; Sciences and Engineering, Business and Social Sciences. On March 21, 2011, the University was officially dedicated and commenced full operation."," Omu-Aran, Kwara State",https://www.lmu.edu.ng,{},23,LU,support@lmu.edu.ng,8067394515,1,"{https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6Nl9U742N7s_5p1DkBgBkAkmxNOaRNlWNAi8W=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuKGJ7ZZm34InVxxISSSR9s-LvrEFr-YeAvmbF=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2vCjTcJD0uUHXBvX-yvQjKNgEqjtA43zlvDfQ=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDQua03e74ZQKz1Wk8YA9YN7yoY_KYwnuSBtjZ=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNP4AxtWvyeVrCxReLpYzAZq0ZalOA_eL5jmsQQ=s680-w680-h510}",2011

The Ministry was created in July 1989 at the home of Dr. D.K Olukoya with 24 members. Today, membership of the church has grown to millions worldwide. MFM runs missionary activities in over 40 nations of the world cutting across Africa, Europe, America and Asia. The core vision of MFM is total liberty of men and women from all forms of oppressions and bondages through the teaching of biblical principles and aggressive prayer strategies for a victorious living. It is against this backdrop that the vision for the establishment of Mountain Top University was derived from the founding Ministry. The promulgation of the Education Decree No. 9 of 1993, which repealed the Decree No. 19 of 1984 and stipulated new guidelines on the establishment of private universities, was therefore a welcome development. Mountain Top University is one of the private Universities in Nigeria, founded in 2015.

The Mountain Top University is envisioned as a dynamic centre of excellence in the liberal tradition for the production of top-rated, morally sound graduates of distinctions who will be globally competitive for outstanding impact on the Nigerian societal and global development.

The Mission of Mountain Top University is the provision of excellent facilities for the training of men and women in various academic, professional and vocational disciplines in an atmosphere that will enhance the simultaneous development of their spiritual, mental and physical faculties, in order to produce morally upright and academically sound graduates with specialised skills and value systems, who will be independent, invariably self-employable and who will be able to impact positively on the development (be it in leadership, academic, public and the industrial sectors) of their communities, the Nigerian society and the global community at large.","Pakuro, Ogun State",https://www.mtu.edu.ng,{},27,MTU,support@mtu.edu.ng,,1,"{https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNefBrqZqbmBVDjldo6TjsZmPGa9XEQcrOvzhmj=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZqaUrHVY1MhiAVLYYvGWq_bLPHCAQmMYiL2dh=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOK7UBR0Ih3tfwnl5GiAv7sb8Ia-DzWmjyyYZIw=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe3f5Ncm8D9EgK3ZeoC8rmmsCuD4WCdR77XGKu=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoaFJG_cup6VM4dposceq0wFxDL-s6eZpX-c1T=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSdzr-nuPOa2p27IZswzGh-MDgmH5B0tcLXxd4=s680-w680-h510}",2015

As the University grew and thrived over the following years, the need to provide its high-quality instruction at a higher level became increasingly apparent.

In 2020, Nile University joined the Honoris United Universities network, the first and largest pan-African private higher education network.

Currently, Nile University has over 6,000 students (undergraduate and postgraduate), 38 undergraduate programs across six faculties, and 51 postgraduate programs across five faculties.

We are all conversant with what had happened to the Nigerian educational system out of which the University education has suffered innumerable punches from cheating at the UME and racket admission, lack of facilities, constant strikes by staff and students, secrets cultism, examination malpractice, bizarre academic calendar etc. The result of these punches is a University system that has been technically knocked out (TKO). The three conventional University competencies of Teaching, Research and Community Service have been completely compromised because none of the three is receiving the attention it deserves. The promoters of Renaissance thus conceived of a University that will bring a complete rebirth to the University education system in Nigeria.

Renaissance University (RNU), an institution established with excellence as its focus, was one of eight tertiary institutions issued with licence to operate as a Private University in 2005 by National Universities Commission (NUC).

However, of all the eight Private Universities, Renaissance University is unique in the sense that it is the only one that started on a virgin land without infrastructure or utilities. This affected the immediate take off of the University until September, 2007 when the gates of the University were opened to the pioneer students.

Renaissance University’s focus is exclusively on academic, technical and ethical excellence and we set out to change the face of University education in Nigeria through a carefully structured and efficiently executed curriculum aimed at producing the total man who will always be preferred in the job market than the other graduates. This is in line with our vision whose key phase is “to be a centre of excellence” and our mission which is “to produce a roundly trained universal man, who is well motivated and poised to accelerate national development, using sound knowledge and application of innovations in Arts, Science and Technology”.

Since we have just taken off, there is not much done yet in the area of research but in line with our “communiversity” spirit we are poised to embark on razor-edge researches that will benefit the agrarian community we are located in. Arrangements are on to satisfy this focus as we intensify our determination to put in place our virtual library that will afford our students and staff access to research reports all over the world. The University has a unique policy that requires academic staff and research fellows to carry out researches that would attract grants if they will continue to be retained on University’s strength. The University is also putting in place a large farm that will be used not only to generate revenue but largely to enhance agricultural research."," Enugu, Enugu State",https://www.rnu.edu.ng,{},14,RNU,registrar@rnu.edu.ng,7035824637,1,"{https://scontent.fabv2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/237883795_4858803777468376_1002760015923105100_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=MPhD5XDITaAAX98Zlbo&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent.fabv2-2.fna&oh=00_AfAu7pW51b-cEai9qt34VSFDtkKyWWcS0Hw92dty8oRTLw&oe=6477E11C,https://scontent.fabv2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/239093178_4858803677468386_2205765199387593666_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=K6yj16NLo3wAX8H70S9&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent.fabv2-2.fna&oh=00_AfBMj31fdLMzLeVqOkMUsHNAAVRkYzG5qNH2zWdVrMXM8w&oe=6477D81F,https://scontent.fabv2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/237938271_4858803847468369_4212349145754027329_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_eui2=AeFktbqKBQkmQcmp-aaupoq1UvThai7UqjxS9OFqLtSqPHFnPymVXqGA4Aez-OrvxMTXZ7IuUiENju7Nz4YUmXBB&_nc_ohc=g8PONmff2v8AX8fH83D&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent.fabv2-2.fna&oh=00_AfD5zOVEIakjFmyJRShFwcxWwuiN6uPbPfTfzBhqQM3_kg&oe=6476511A,https://scontent.fabv2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/237418737_4858803257468428_7498896016990996475_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_eui2=AeGBjRXTLquw25WMspH834qHpQc2h2C1jsGlBzaHYLWOwepgTGRVfyZJkb3vWokKeH-8_2q8wpeFZ6iF0jERlF3x&_nc_ohc=s-KH-4IQZjoAX9_blYA&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent.fabv2-1.fna&oh=00_AfCK7pqwhDpAQAcjMDif6H7u_9NGg3bmSri6xmlL_blBmw&oe=64772619,https://scontent.fabv2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/237612822_4858803274135093_6115540593146746217_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_eui2=AeHQfWSvb_gRXY3joDRgzZDmkl0SI_aPDpuSXRIj9o8Om3hO06WsE-NnTVJiDCkv35CUUZk9maFi-9tBjcQZDYA5&_nc_ohc=yfSexn8slDUAX8Po19c&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent.fabv2-2.fna&oh=00_AfDE7kkxqhFNhVbG2fjodL9s9aenynkpjBWzRa4BnPnMMg&oe=6477AD68}",2005

Education in freedom and for freedom: 
Strong beliefs and values can only be acquired in an atmosphere of responsible freedom. You will therefore be afforded the liberty necessary to enable you freely internalise good values. Thus empowered, you will be expected to make decisions and to be accountable for those decisions.

The university which is fully residential has an estimated enrollment of around 400 students (expected to reach 3,500) and has replaced St Paul''s University College which was founded in 1904 by the Church Missionary Society of the Church of England to train church workers and teachers. Although, Paul University Awka is a Private University, the Anambra State government under Governor Peter Obi donated cash and vehicles for its infrastructural upgrade and development.

Paul University has affiliate institutions like Institute of Theology which is headed by the Director, Ven Dr Rex Kanu.

The first Board of Trustee was headed by a former Vice President of Nigeria, Dr Alex Ekwueme (GCON) who also built the Administrative Offices which houses the Senate Chamber.

Paul University, Awka currently has three faculties and these faculties offer a variety of courses. The faculties are; Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences, Faculty of Management and Social Sciences, and Faculty of Arts. In addition, it runs an Institute of Theology, which it inherited from the defunct St. Paul''s University College, and also admits students into the JUPEB and Continuing Education Programme (CEP).

This dream could not come true because of the existence of Decree No. 19 of 1984, which proscribed and banned the establishment and operation of private universities. The opportunity was however made available by the Federal Government of Nigeria, when Decree No. 9 of 1993 was promulgated, allowing private individuals or organisations to establish universities in Nigeria, provided they meet certain criteria laid down by the Federal Government through the National Universities Commission (NUC).

In order to realise its dream, the RCCG and the proprietors of the university initially acquired a large expanse of land in Ede South Local Government Area of Osun State, having obtained the Certificate of Statutory Right of Occupancy in 1997. The site of the university covers an area of about 812 hectares. However, during an assessment visit of facilities for the take-off of the university, the NUC advised the acquisition of a parcel of land within the vicinity of the take-off campus as the permanent site. Therefore, the university, through the proprietor, acquired about 500 hectares of land close to the take-off campus situated between Ibafo and Asese Junction at Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State on Lagos/Ibadan Expressway.

The proprietors of RUN have followed with keen interest the development of university education in Nigeria and are poised not only to provide additional places but to considerably improve upon the existing standard of delivery. In particular, it has been observed that a high percentage of eligible candidates cannot secure admissions to the various programmes in the universities due to limited availability of places. The situation is expected to worsen with increasing number of candidates seeking admissions to tertiary educational institutions in the coming years. The present proposal to establish Redeemer’s University is therefore a noble effort towards producing the requisite high level manpower required for the development of the nation.

The vision is to be the foremost institution for producing graduates who combine academic excellence in the practice of their profession with God-fearing attributes. The proprietors are committed to the realisation of this dream."," Ede, Osun State",https://www.run.edu.ng,{},29,RUN,info@run.edu.ng,7007008000,1,"{https://run.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Redeemers-university-libary.jpg,https://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/MmI7MDA_/28d59ec4b3c166e7c4ebb0622b8255db.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EP6s9ntWAAI6rT8.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5e1255cfb135de2d59bf7bba/889aee82-8d29-45eb-8795-c37cdd888e6f/IMG-20220422-WA0092.jpg?format=1000w}",2005

Methodist Church Nigeria was established in the Country in 1842 by the Methodist Society from Britain. While engaging in their main goal of evangelizing and converting the people, the Methodists recognized the need to train a number of people who can read the Bible and serve as assistants to the Missionaries. The Methodists therefore ventured into education of the people and set up the first “Nursery of the Infant Church” in Badagry in 1843. This marked the first initiative at establishing schools in Nigeria.

Over the years of its existence, the Methodist Church has shown interest and (had in fact) participated in the development of Education, Health and Agriculture in the country with the establishment of Primary and Secondary Schools, Teacher Training Colleges, Theological Institutions, Hospitals, Leprosy Centres and various agricultural projects.

From the historical viewpoint, the Church was regarded as a preserver of knowledge. In the world today, education is viewed as a vocational training for the young, an education which disciplines the mind, develops the reasoning power and enables the young graduate to find employment and be of good service to the Church and the community.

To this effect, following the decision of the Federal Government of Nigeria to permit the establishment and running of private Universities by individuals or organizations based on Federal Government’s criteria through the National Universities Commission, the Church decided to establish Wesley University of Science and Technology, expected to be a centre of excellence, committed to regeneration of good moral standards among the youths. MCN also observed the need to provide improved standard of delivery as well as provide additional places for the teeming population of young people who cannot be reasonably accommodated in the existing institutions.

The University was granted official license by the National Universities Commission (NUC) on May 17, 2007. Consequently, the official opening ceremony took place on May 14, 2008, at the University site in Ondo town, while full academic activities commenced in October, 2008, with the admission and resumption of the University’s pioneer students.

We strive to provide the enabling environment for effective teaching and research in cutting-edge science and technology for sustainable development. The Wesley University of our dream is not just a university that provides facilities for teaching and research but one in which moral regeneration of our children would be approached through formal and informal means, so as to ensure stimulation of interest in national development from moral, cultural and religious perspectives.","Ondo, Ondo State",https://www.wesleyuni.edu.ng,{},28,WU,info@wesleyuni.edu.ng,9067834913,1,"{https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wesley-university.jpg,https://assets-delawarebusinesstimes-com.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/2020/06/Wesley-College.jpg,https://admissions.wesleyuni.edu.ng/images/banner-bg.png}",2007

At various times, it has successfully established very strong and robust linkages between the private sector and the academia with emphasis on capacity building and management training. This stride was a very strong motivation for the establishment of a university, with strong emphasis on the management sciences, that relies on linkages with the corporate world, locally and internationally. This close collaboration and consultation between academia and industry will lead to the development and establishment of high level management training programs relevant to the immediate and future manpower needs of the corporate world and the public sector.

In venturing into this great task, the promoter, took time to study what exist in the abreast of the educational sector, noting the shortcomings in human and capital development, the challenges of business and management in the contemporary global knowledge economy and felt compelled to intervene with a view to establishing a first class institution that will train students, who upon graduation, shall  be equipped with the requisite skills, knowledge and competencies to fit into the industry and public sector in any part of the world and be key players in their various fields of specialization.

The burning quest, of many Nigerians for quality university education and the few spaces available for them to realize their ambitions and fulfill their aspiration provided further impetus for the establishment of Christopher University as a contribution to the national effort aimed at enhancing access to quality university education in a location close to Lagos, a  melting pot and the country''s commercial / Industrial nerve centre.

The responsibility of meeting the objectives of Christopher University was initially vested in the Planning and Implementation Committee (PIC), made up of men of integrity, skills and experience.

The interest of the Founder in the sphere of Education of Nigerians can be traced back to 1993 with the establishment of Kola Daisi Foundation. Already, the Foundation has made numerous impacts on the life of many Nigerians through its various donations and contributions to Nigerian Universities, endowment of prizes, award of scholarship and operation of Vocational Skills Acquisition Programme to address youth unemployment, underemployment, restiveness through training and retraining of unemployed youths. The Foundation has therefore garnered several years of experience in the provision of education and training of youth as well as collaboration with higher education and training institutions in the country. The desire of the Founder, Chief Kola Daisi to deepen his involvement in provision of education and training of youths culminated in the establishment of University that will be a legacy for generations to come.

Popularly called the Dominican Order, the Order of Preachers was founded by Spanish priest Dominic de Guzman in 1216 with the approval of Pope Innocent III.

The Dominican University in Ibadan was established on the 800th anniversary of the foundation of the Order.

Illustrious Dominicans, such as the scientist and philosopher Albert the Great, and his student, the philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas, were towering intellectuals in pioneering universities of Europe in Paris, Bologna, Oxford and Cologne.

Envisioned to provide high quality education in the humanities, management, science and technology, the Dominican University is unflinching in her commitment to form a new generation of leaders at the service of Nigeria and the global community, leaders who will use the multiple competence acquired in this University to work for their own good by serving the common good.

The mission of the University is to assist Nigeria to achieve the greatness her potential warrants by bringing together peoples of ethnic, religious and cultural diversity, into an academic community conducive to research, teaching and learning, to become a driving force for solidarity and authentic development of a new humanity.

The Dominican philosophy of education which the University espouses is rooted in the conviction that authentic development is centred on the human person and is the outcome of artistic, technical and ethical competence, research and teaching that bring together valid achievements of the past and the best accomplishments of the present, and recourse to traditional African values that point to ways of overcoming contemporary challenges.

For more than two decades, the Dominican Institute has been running a Bachelor of Arts philosophy degree programme, fully accredited by the National Universities Commission, and a Bachelor of Theology degree programme accredited by the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education. Its impressive track record, excellent facilities, enormous human resources, and the more than 800 years of Dominican involvement in tertiary education mean the Dominican University can boast of having emerged from a position of strength.","Ibadan, Oyo State",https://www.dui.edu.ng/,{},30,DU,info@dui.edu.ng,9055588867,1,"{https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMR4sH0SZnhai2JoNuLM1YjcC6MMxDuOIkPbDTI=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNWjr-eRRzYSyX7Mt_ydQSZhNIMRIo77N75nf2=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOXg99w93N9iTUj-XRMDZlbBUaTraCcYM0r4-9=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkiExJb3W1VuXYJJpD1H68xn1-7ccn4LT9EuFr=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXRYORf-yNhkeDJc7vQq5WAwQS67npQ2y_qBGu=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaB3Y1rFGCHy-prCd6VoLQebb_MzWyc1UfSn_N=s680-w680-h510,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvr6Gs7XgP1yq78lhJvz6VyuSiC8XTE4COnYEJ=s680-w680-h510}",2016
